ps
	The ps (i.e., process status) command is used to provide information about the currently running processes, including their process identification numbers (PIDs).

Pipes and redirection:
	 ls -l > lsoutput.txt

	 ps >> lsoutput.txt
			
		will append the output of the ps command to the end of the specified file.


	Suppose you want to use the kill command to kill a process from a script. There is always a slight risk that the process will die before the kill command is executed. If this happens, kill will write an error message to the standard error output, which, by default, will appear on the screen. By redirecting both the standard output and the error, you can prevent the kill command from writing any text to the screen.
	The command
		
		$ kill -HUP 1234 >killout.txt 2>killerr.txt

	will put the output and error information into separate files.
