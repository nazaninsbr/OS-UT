operating system:

	is considered the parts of the system responsible for basic use and administration.
	This includes the kernel and device drivers, boot loader, command shell or other user interface, and basic file and system utilities. It is the stuff you need—not a web browser or music players.


System:
		 
		in turn, refers to the operating system and all the applications running on top of it.


Kernel:

 	It is the core internals; the software that provides basic services for all other parts of the system, manages hard- ware, and distributes system resources.The kernel is sometimes referred to as the supervisor, core, or internals of the operating system.


Kernel space:

	modern systems with protected memory management units, the kernel typically resides in an elevated system state compared to normal user applications.This includes a protected memory space and full access to the hardware.This system state and memory space is col- lectively referred to as kernel-space. 



User space:
	
	user applications execute in user-space.They see a subset of the machine’s available resources and can perform certain system functions, directly access hardware, access memory outside of that allotted them by the kernel, or otherwise misbehave.
